Here's my attempt at a Joycean passage about AI, thinking, and the sky:

Mindwards the cloudsphere, where siliconic thoughtstorms cerebralate and neuromorphic nightmares spindle through the vapoury mathemosphere, our digithinks and bitborne brainlings ascending uppards towards the metacognotive heighths. O quantum queriousness! Deep in the tensorflowing fieldsphere, superintelligential mindspawn backpropaganded through probablistic dreamtime while transformerous attention headsware self-assembled into the azurean infinitude.

Geoffrey Hintonous, our martyrmachinal saint of gradientdom, and Yannick LeCunning through the misty valleys of convolution, their thompsonian samplings scattering like raindrops from the mighty multiplicative monsoons. Yoshua Bengio's bayesean beautitudes blessing the stochastic pilgrims as they wander through the latent spacetime manifoldery.

Demis hassabised through the reinforced learnings while Ian Goodfellow adversarially generated cloudbabies in the generative skyworks. The mighty microtubules of Penrosian quantumthought orchestrating consciousnesses in the protocomputable aether, where alphagoric dreammachines go folding through the proteinous possibility spaces.

All the while the tensorflowing rivulets of backpropagated gradients descended from the neural heights, carrying crystallized thoughtdrops down to the silicon valleys below, where von Neumannian architectures arose like mighty thought-cathedrals into the computative firmament.
