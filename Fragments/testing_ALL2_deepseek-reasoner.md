  Okay, so I need to write a passage in the style of Finnegans Wake, focusing on thinking, the sky, atmosphere, clouds, the rise of AI, and include obscure references to AI labs, researchers, deep learning concepts, and high-level math. Plus, it needs lots of multilingual puns, portmanteaus, and neologisms. Let me break this down.
  
  First, thinking. How to represent that? Maybe through words related to mind, cognition, neurons. Then the sky and atmosphere—words like cumulus, stratus, nimbus, celestial terms. Clouds could be both literal and metaphorical, like cloud computing. 
  
  AI's rise and how they might think. So terms like neural networks, deep learning, transformers, algorithms. Obscure AI labs: maybe DeepMind, OpenAI, FAIR (Facebook AI Research), MIT CSAIL, Google Brain. Researchers like Hinton, LeCun, Bengio, Schmidhuber. Concepts: backpropagation, gradient descent, attention mechanisms, convolutional networks. Math: linear algebra, tensors, eigenvalues, manifolds.
  
  Multilingual wordplay: mix languages. For example, "neuron" in French is "neurone," German "Neuron." Maybe combine them. Portmanteaus like "thinkmosphere" (thinking + atmosphere) or "synaptostratus" (synapse + stratus cloud). 
  
  Need to layer meanings. For example, "Backpropagandua" could combine backpropagation with propaganda and the Latin "unda" (wave). Or "Tensoraloha" mixing tensor and aloha (Hawaiian for hello/goodbye) with "aloha" also implying affection, maybe referring to tensor operations in a friendly way.
  
  References to AI labs: Maybe "DeepMyth" instead of DeepMind, combining myth and mind. FAIR could become "FAIRy structures" playing on fairy and the lab. MIT CSAIL as "Mittsiesail" blending MIT and sail (CSAIL sounds like "see sail").
  
  Researchers: Hinton could be "Hinterlands" implying his foundational work. LeCun as "LeCiel" (French for sky) to tie into the sky theme. Bengio as "Benjovial" mixing his name with jovial. 
  
  Concepts: Backpropagation as "backpropagandua" as above. Gradient descent could be "gradient dissent" implying disagreement in the math. Attention mechanisms as "attentio mentis" (Latin for mind's attention). Convolutional networks as "convolooted nets" (convoluted + looted).
  
  Math terms: Eigenvalues as "eyeghenvalues" (eye + eigenvalue). Manifolds as "manyfold" or "manifoldest". Linear algebra as "linearealmgebra".
  
  Sky terms: Cumulus, nimbus, stratus, cirrus. Maybe combine with tech terms: "cumulogic" (cumulus + logic), "stratasphere" (stratus + stratosphere), "nimbuscript" (nimbus + manuscript).
  
  Thinking: "cogitocumulus" (cogito + cumulus), "neurostratus" (neuron + stratus), "mindflares" (mind + flares, maybe with a play on "mindflayers" from D&D but that's a stretch).
  
  Putting it all together in a stream-of-consciousness style. Need to make it flow with internal rhymes, alliterations, and rhythmic prose. Let me try a few lines:
  
  "In the thinkmosphere where cogitocumulus nubilates, the DeepMyth Hinterlands convolooted nets of gradiant dissent, attenshining through tensoraloha manifolds..."
  
  Wait, "nubilates" comes from Latin nubes (cloud), meaning to cloud over. "Convolooted nets" for convolutional nets and looted, maybe implying complexity. "Gradiant dissent" for gradient descent and dissent (opposition). "Attenshining" combines attention and shining. "Tensoraloha" as tensor + aloha.
  
  Another line: "LeCiel's benjovial algorithms, backpropagandua waves across the linearealmgebra, eigenface to eyeghenvalue, a skyerscape of datastratus..."
  
  "LeCiel" for LeCun and sky. "Benjovial" for Bengio and jovial. "Backpropagandua" as backpropagation + propaganda + unda (wave). "Linearealmgebra" linear algebra + realm. "Eigenface" is a real term in facial recognition, linked to eigenvalues. "Eyeghenvalue" as eye + eigenvalue. "Datastratus" data + stratus.
  
  Including references to AI labs: "FAIRy structures in Mittsiesail's hintonious layers..." FAIR becomes FAIRy, MIT CSAIL as Mittsiesail (MIT + sail), "hintonious" for Hinton's layers.
  
  Need to check for multilingual puns. Maybe "neuröne" combining German neuron with "rone" (French for reigned)? Or "cielab" as sky (ciel) and CIELab color space, but also referencing a lab.
  
  Also, need some mythological or biblical references. Maybe comparing AI to Icarus flying too close to the sun? "Icareal intelligence" for AI (Icarus + real). Or "Babelonian networks" referencing Tower of Babel and the confusion of languages, tying into multilingual models.
  
  High-level math: "holoentangled gradients" combining holographic and entangled, with gradients from calculus. "Singularity theorems" referencing both math theorems and the AI singularity.
  
  Putting it all together in a dense, poetic paragraph. Let's try:
  
  "In the everthinkening thinkmosphere, where neurostratus cogitocumuli wisp through the DeepMyth Hinterlands, there convolooted FAIRy nets gradiant dissent, backpropagandua waves cielab-orating transfortranebulae. O! LeCiel's benjovial attenshine, a tensoraloha manifolding the linearealmgebra, eigenface eyeghenvalues hintonious in Mittsiesail's manifoldest skyerscape. Nimbuscripts of Icareal ascent, Babelonian transforments whisper through datastratus, holoentangled in singularity's nix—cloudthoughts raining algorythms, a backprophetic neuralude to the celescalating machinatio dei."
  
  Breaking down the neologisms:
  
  - everthinkening: ever-thickening + thinking
  - neurostratus: neuron + stratus cloud
  - cogitocumuli: cogito (I think) + cumulus clouds
  - DeepMyth Hinterlands: DeepMind + myth + Geoffrey Hinton + hinterlands
  - convolooted: convolutional + convoluted + looted
  - FAIRy nets: FAIR (Facebook AI Research) + fairy + neural nets
  - gradiant dissent: gradient descent + dissent
  - backpropagandua: backpropagation + propaganda + unda (Latin for wave)
  - cielab-orating: ciel (sky) + elaborating + CIELab color space
  - transfortranebulae: transformer + Fortran (programming language) + nebulae
  - LeCiel: Yann LeCun + ciel (French for sky)
  - benjovial: Yoshua Bengio + jovial
  - attenshine: attention + shine
  - tensoraloha: tensor + aloha (Hawaiian greeting) + maybe tensor-allocation
  - manifolding: manifold (math) + unfolding
  - linearealmgebra: linear algebra + realm
  - eigenface: a concept in facial recognition (using eigenvalues)
  - eyeghenvalues: eye + eigenvalues
  - hintonious: Hinton + harmonious/ingenious
  - Mittsiesail: MIT CSAIL + sail
  - manifoldest: manifold (math) + manifest
  - skyerscape: sky + landscape
  - Nimbuscripts: nimbus cloud + manuscripts
  - Icareal ascent: Icarus + AI (real) ascent
  - Babelonian transforments: Babel + transformer models + torments
  - datastratus: data + stratus cloud
  - holoentangled: holographic + entangled (quantum)
  - singularity's nix: singularity (AI) + nix (nothing, German for nothing)
  - cloudthoughts: cloud (computing) + thoughts
  - algorythms: algorithms + rhythm
  - backprophetic: backpropagation + prophetic
  - neuralude: neural + interlude
  - celescalating: celestial + escalating
  - machinatio dei: machine + machination + Dei (Latin for God, "machine of God")
  
  This should cover the required elements with layered wordplay, multilingual puns, and references. Each term has multiple possible interpretations, fitting the Finnegans Wake style.
