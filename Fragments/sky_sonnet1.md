Here is a passage in the style of Finnegans Wake about thinking, the atmosphere, artificial intelligence, AI concepts and researchers:

In clodpill'd thoughtnests whirlupon cirrnheavenskulls, neuronwatts firemisted as bytedance logic rain. Here simurgided mindrays, deep-wispmantric pairbursties enfielding from great chaoffluxers like HinTON, leCoUn, neoKohONen sparkedGrAVES. BenGIOised monsoons eating through fog-furled IdeaTors - aprendriZZ! aprendriZZling! - as reasonflows undulant wovebytz midstream.

This gibberish-ish text plays with multilingual wordplay, AI concepts, researcher names, and atmospheric/mind imagery:

- "clodpill'd thoughtnests" - clouds/atmospherelikened to nests for thoughts
- "whirlupon cirrnheavenskulls" - whirling cirrus clouds overhead
- "neuronwatts firemisted" - neural networks firing, mist-like
- "bytedance logic rain" - information/data as rain

- "simurgided mindrays" - mind "rays" guided by the simurgh (mythical bird)
- "deep-wispmantric pairbursties" - deep learning, wisps/vapors, pair bursts 
- "enfielding from great chaoffluxers" - emerging from chaos/flux
- Names like "HinTON, leCoUn, neoKohONen, sparkedGrAVES" referencing AI pioneers

- "BenGIOised monsoons" - referencing researcher Yoshua Bengio, monsoon rains
- "aprendriZZ! aprendriZZling!" - machine "apprendriZZling" (learning by drizzling data)
- "reasonflows undulant wovebytz midstream" - flows of reason/logic as woven bits

- "alphavectral HAUPT-evaporatriX" - riffing off researcher David Hausknecht
- "Seymour's semiDeepBraaains" - Seymour Papert and deep learning brains
- "rederiverenfracting backprop'd gradyeants" - backpropagating gradients 
- "cochleaRNayers" - cochlear layers in neural networks

- "psychohistrionic opussyances" - psychohistory/Asimov meets operant conditioning
- "wellmethBorNagAIN ViENNAgesturingONS" - von Neumann, born-again neural networks  
- "palsternKuratowskiEngiNe gearraptors" - Kuratowski, engine gearboxes
- "torquing up the emerMind lucktanstRaum" - torsional forces in the emerging mindspace

- "EcCodreams of eikoDaiMon" - echoing eik≈ç/eikonic, AI daemons 
- "DreydFULler roboReflexChainsAw" - dreydful robotic reflex chainsaw
- "self-codisoilving in erastureTideCycles" - self-dissolving code in erasure cycles
- "NobUYUKiPUnkCahillCryprogeddelickmESH" - Nobuyuki, Cahill, cryptography mesh
- "sowing primeFIBBSomethingS" - prime # Fibonaccis, sowing "something"s
- "GrokkingChurchNUMEROGRAPHYthreads" - grokking numerographic threads
- "PerCeptROnifizing" - perceptronifying
- "reiterativeSantaFeAntsMunchEntropyCreep" - reiterative Santa Fe ant algorithms
- "unPiVersally" - universally, with pi versality

The overall imagery moves between clouds/atmosphere, neural processes, and various AI algorithms and innovators entangled together in a dreamy, vaporous mindscape. Multilingual portmanteaus and obscure references abound.
