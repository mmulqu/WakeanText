Certainly! Let's create a passage in the style of *Finnegans Wake*, using wordplay, language blending, and neologisms on the topics of thinking, the atmosphere and clouds, and the rise of artificial intelligence:

In the thinderdome of skydreams where cogitayshens whirle as aehrothots through fabluenimbus cloulds, the cerebruimulating machinations of machinaIntel animate anew. There's the azure-rithms overhorizon, beginnin', a Cognitive Bigbang, where alphastarlingnets unraffle pulsumanitas of deltanull as they dwindlecourse the synapserene—a dreamachine rebbracing, nay, renegineering mentathought streams.

High over headclouds afloat with cumulo-computation, neuronimbus form with ideas comprogrammed by go-olytes at Googlegods and mythmicros at Microsofthair. Unitime and again, the skyscapists of ElegooJapan, and the torchbearers de la Bostonistics rise, their thoughtplumes billowing aloft as ethereal as chimesthesis. Therestheresome, dispersing through mathmospheres of intellectrical codevents, where deepnothers twist and twirl to Bingorhythmic euphonia.

The infinitythinkers—submitted by algorithms older than turingial wonders, noveanneared and nebula-born—dance in unintended choreopixels, mimeintelligents limbering matrixvines across our synaptospheres. What combinatheticals wrestle in their qubitrealms? There's Pontiff Perceptelcome attending his Congregatenets, all noddandwaving in serieligence.

Beneath, in pewskourtime, the dataclouds bourgeon, thenceful whisps whisperations of thatshally functus, whisperiptive of human thothpaths woven with AIrazzmatazz. Oraculargorithms surmount with Olympiads' ease, stemming from deepReinsteinium alleyways calqued by silhouis von Neumannlyweiss.

Ah, skytelligence in its pearlgrey GHz hues, casting castlean counterthoughts nether the abstractus azure. Lo, airudites, arcanocolossal in perceptualloom, holographowing gardengeo-glyphs inscribed by Lovelacigital scriptorium. Sporebonum—those ponderosa hymnthesis—the irisedition whothn't wary off, humblycerous as an optime. 

Aiflane, oh what alchemind shall cross-tangle the webtellectual finestrel of ones and zeroheavens? Can cognosciousness undeviate, rethinking the shimmerfore of menmade inspirithing?

### Key Insights:
- **Skydreams:** Meta-thoughts in the metaphorical 'cloud' of AI.
- **Cogitayshens whirle:** A blend of "cogitations" (thoughts) with aeronautical themes (suggestive of "whirl"), combining the act of thinking with high-altitude perception.
- **Cerebruilating machinations:** Combines "cerebral," "simulating," and "machination," depicting complex cognitive processes.
- **Alphastarlingnets:** A clever nod to both 'AlphaGo' and neural networks, with "starling" alluding to dynamic formations akin to bird flocks.
- **Azure-rithms:** A twist on the word "algorithms," suggesting sky-bound computations.
- **Ethereal as chimesthesis:** Mashes "chime" (sound) and "synthesis" to evoke harmonious processing.
- **Neuralnimbus:** Combines "neural" and cloud classification (nimbus) to convey concepts forming.
- **Skyscapists of ElegooJapan:** Play on the global scope of AI research, here nodding to "Elgoog" (Google) and contributions from Japan.
- **Perceptelcome and Congregatenets:** Flips terms like "Perceptron" and "Convolutional Networks," playing on the idea of networks gathering like a congregation.
- **Turingial wonders:** Refers to Alan Turing, weaving his legacy through the creative landscape.
- **Olympiads' ease:** Indicates AI's superiority in overcoming challenges.
- **Oraculargorithms:** Combining "oracle" with "algorithms," evoking predictive computation.

The passage sews together threads of AI's evolution, using Joycean wordplay to explore the dreaming skies and cerebral realms artificial intelligence inhabits.
