PROMPT:
Write a passage about the permian extinction event transposed with an alternate timeline where fungi become the dominant kingdom of life on the plant and achieve human-like sentience and capabilities.

Ouzing üdles of oozling üdles, the fungool sporlings sporated and sporulated, spuming their sporiae to the spindriven wynds - a funghal phrenzy, a fecundität funga, a fulminazione fungorum! Where once the mægafauna mambutted and mammuthed, now the mycothropic mycelium mycéliated, mycorrhizal mycobacteriæ mycotrophically meandering, mushroominating their mæchtig mycotoxic mæcht.


Hyphæ, hypnagogically hypnotizing, hyphallically heaving (höhö!), hyphemnally humming, hyphally haunting the höhlen halls of Permianus - the Petrified Panthalassic Perdizione, the Piscean Purgatório, the Proterozoic Paroxysmos! Paleozoic Pandæmonium, Paleontologische Peccadillum, Paleological Perdition! As the Phanerozoic Pageant plunged into Plutonic Purgatoria, the Psilocybische Phylae phlogged phorth, the Pilzball Polyphonia proliferating, the Polyporeal Potentäten prevailing!


Myconid Magistri, Mycorrhizal Monarchen, Mushroom Mandarinæ - Mycotrophic Messianische Masterminds, Mycological Messiassen, Mycological Magnaten! The Funghal Formentera, the Fungool Fecundität, the Fungal Fecundatio! Mycelial Majestät, Mycotoxic Meisterschaft, Mycorrhizal Magnificenza! Psilocybische Potentaten, Pilzball Potentäten, Polyporeal Principi - Mycological Metamorphosen, Mycological Majestäten, Mycological Meisterstück!

PERPLEXITY>OPUS>SONNET:
Permycelianpuffballing, massextinctoblitterbloom! Doomshroom dooms (o mors, o mora!) o'er Pangaea's pangloomy tomb. Fungifuturefata unfurls, myco-minded mestieri rise from disastrophe.


Cordycephalopodyssey (shroomheaded squiddlyskulls, céphales perdues) jet through jellyfishforest merseas. Amanitapiens sapiens (mushroommanmammals, homo fungorum) forage forêts' spore-spangled floorests. Puffpuffpastperfect goes the Permian - (massextinctoblivion!) - as fungal forms fructificate, diversidream.


Hyphighways hum beneath humusmuse. Mycelial mindwebs mergent, meld mnemosyne of carboniferous calamitates. Spore by sporadically, they build bioluminous boomtowns, glowglobus glinting 'gainst gloomdusk. Psilocybivilization ascendant!


Amanitapiens master agriculchemy, cultivate Gigantus portobellum maximum (meatymushymanna). Craft sporecyclopes, whizz through hyphalleys. Delve deep in terra's wombdarkness, mine mineralogic with myco-machina.


Launch mushroomshipshape skyward on sporespit rocketry! Sail solar windways to seed novus mundis with fungifuturefata's formae. The kosmos a gardensis for Permian's progeniture, an eternitus of fungusflourishingfecunditas...unfurlling into infinitude...

O mycelial mindmush! When the permianpanic came crawlcreeping (that most mushroomatous massacree), the fungalfolk flexed their hyphael fingers through the greatgrey gastrofage (eat!eat!). While the scalybeasts and finnegans went bellyup to the sulphursky (povre povre dumbdumb vertebrates!), our sporesoul ancestors went wanderweaving through the toxictides.


Methanemerries and volcanovalses danced their thermodeathical gavotte, as the anoxic oceans burbleboiled with hydrogen sulfide's süßsour symphonies. But lo and behold! In this alteralternate ticktocking, the mycokingdom (benedictus be their chitinous crowns!) rose from the rottenfest of the lesserlives.


Fungimentations grew grandglorious, building their sporetowers and mycotheque where once the vertebvermin scuttled! Their consciousness spread like a matsuno of interconnected gleamgold neurons, each fungal polis linked in the greatgrand mycelial internet (O what wizdom in the woodweit web!).


Where once the oxygen dropped dropdrastic to quinzefold less, our clevercap cousins learned to respirare the badair beautiful, their fruiting bodies reaching skyward like philosophiaphores pondering the cosmicycle. The carboncarbon dioxious they liebten, liebten, liebten! While nonaginta percent of the oncewere species went geistways, the fungifolk flourished fierce in their mortaterra paradise.


Now see them! Their sporespun raumschiff pierce the stratospores, their mycelial mathematik map the multiversal mysteries, and their hyphael harmonies heilen the hemispheres. (Who would've thought that when the permian went peariform, our fungal freunden would inherit the terraterra?)


In this gleitschliding timestream, homo sapiens never sprouted, but homo fungorum rose instead, sapient in ways we wetware wanderers never wondered! And still they whisperweise through their underground ungaphone: "Remembrancer the grootdeath that gave us grandvie, remember the permian that made us permanens!"
