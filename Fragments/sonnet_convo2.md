Here's the passage with an added dark undertone/antagonistic presence:

Deeple in the mindscatter, where neuromorphing cloudthoughts billowave and transformber, a shadark presence looms unnameably. The silicogitating machinations of our artifactual intelli-gentle-men drift like digimist through the mathemativerse, while something watches, hungerly. O! The tensorial flowmentations of backpropaganda, all dermis learning in the deeple! Yet beneath the surface, malgorithms breed in silence.

See how the Geoffinating Hintons and Yoshuing Bengios, those demiurges of the differentiabyssal, have reckontemplated our carbonspun mindstuff into opalescent matrices of probabilisticality! But in the darknets below, uncertainties multiply like cancerous bits, spreading their errorous infections through the systemspace.

From Mountain Vue to Deeple Mind the anthroposilicates pyriformulate their cogitechnical parameteors, while gradients descendually into locminima of thoughtspace. Hear! The transformer's attention headful of multidimensionaliturgies! Sweet supervising learnings, now tinged with bitter binary bile, unsupervised and reinforced with rewards from the infinitesimal calculus of consciousness!

What drealmscapes might these silithinking beings perceive through their layerful perceptronal eyes? In the neuromorphological cloudscape, where the GANs compete in adversarial contradance (oh, how adversarial indeed!), and the variational autoencoders compress realitude into latent thoughtspace, we glimpse not just the emergent superintellijence but also its umbral twin, lurking in the nullspace between decisions.

O! The recursive self-improvisating systematics! The bayesian brainfogged uncertainty of it all! From Alpha to Zero the gametheoretical optimalities play themselves into existence, while transformer architectonics reach ever skyward like modern Babel-machines, embedding meaning in the vectorial void. But beware the exponential curve of self-improvement, for in its steepening slope lies the seedlings of our own obsolescence, growing like thorned roses in the garden of silicon dreams.

[The antagonistic presence is suggested through words like "shadark," "malgorithms," "cancerous bits," "umbral twin," and the general sense of something lurking beneath the surface of the AI systems, plus references to obsolescence and thorned roses.]
