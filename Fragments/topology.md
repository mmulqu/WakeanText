  Okay, so I need to answer this topology question. Let me read it again carefully. The user says, "Prove that every closed orientable connected 3-manifold is parallelizable." Hmm, okay. Alright, I remember that 3-manifolds have certain properties, especially when they're closed, orientable, and connected. Parallelizable means that the tangent bundle is trivial, right? So the manifold's tangent bundle can be expressed as the product of the manifold with R^3. 
  
  First, I should recall what I know about parallelizable manifolds. A manifold is parallelizable if it has a global frame, which is a set of three everywhere linearly independent vector fields. For 3-manifolds, there might be specific theorems or results that help here. Since the manifold is orientable, that means it has a nowhere vanishing volume form, which might be related but I'm not sure how directly. 
  
  I think Stiefel-Whitney classes could be involved here. For a manifold to be parallelizable, all its Stiefel-Whitney classes should vanish. The first Stiefel-Whitney class is related to orientability. Since the manifold is orientable, w1 is zero. For the second and third classes, maybe they also vanish in this case? But I'm not entirely sure. I need to check what's known about Stiefel-Whitney classes for 3-manifolds.
  
  Wait, in three dimensions, the tangent bundle has rank 3. Maybe there's a way to use the fact that the manifold is orientable and has trivial Euler characteristic? Wait, no, Euler characteristic for odd-dimensional closed manifolds is zero, right? So for a 3-manifold, the Euler characteristic is zero. But how does that relate to parallelizability?
  
  Another thought: the Hirsch-Smale theory might have something to do with immersions or embeddings, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable. Maybe using the fact that the manifold is spin? Since it's orientable, and spin if the second Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes. If it's spin, then maybe there's a relation to having trivial tangent bundle. But I need to check if all closed orientable 3-manifolds are spin.
  
  Wait, the second Stiefel-Whitney class w2 is the obstruction to the manifold being spin. If w2 is zero, then it's spin. For 3-manifolds, since the tangent bundle is 3-dimensional, the second Stiefel-Whitney class can be computed using the Wu formula. Wu classes relate Stiefel-Whitney classes to the cohomology of the manifold. For a 3-manifold, the Wu class v2 is equal to Sq^1(v1) + Sq^2(v0), but maybe this is getting too technical. Alternatively, in dimension 3, the Wu class v2 is zero because the manifold is orientable. Then by the Wu formula, w2 = v2, so w2 = 0. Therefore, all orientable 3-manifolds are spin. So they admit spin structures. But does being spin help in parallelizability? Not necessarily directly, but maybe in combination with other properties.
  
  I also remember that in lower dimensions, certain manifolds are parallelizable. For example, all orientable 3-manifolds are parallelizable. Is that a theorem? I think so. The proof might involve using the fact that the tangent bundle is trivial. Since the manifold is orientable, the first Stiefel-Whitney class is zero, and we just saw that the second is also zero. For the third Stiefel-Whitney class, which is in H^3(M; Z/2), but since the manifold is 3-dimensional, H^3 is Z/2 if it's closed and orientable. But the top Stiefel-Whitney class is the mod 2 reduction of the Euler class. Wait, but the Euler characteristic is zero, so the Euler class would be zero? But the Euler class is defined for even-dimensional manifolds. In odd dimensions, like 3, the Euler class is zero. So maybe all Stiefel-Whitney classes vanish, implying that the tangent bundle is trivial by a theorem? But I need to check if that's the case.
  
  Alternatively, maybe there's a more direct approach. For 3-manifolds, since they can be framed. Wait, framed manifolds are those with trivializations of their tangent bundles. But not all 3-manifolds are framed, but in this case, the theorem claims they are. 
  
  Another angle: using the fact that every closed orientable 3-manifold is the boundary of a 4-manifold. But not sure how that helps. Maybe using the fact that the tangent bundle is trivial if the manifold can be parallelized. 
  
  Wait, I recall a theorem by J. H. C. Whitehead that every closed orientable 3-manifold is parallelizable. But I need to recall the proof idea. Alternatively, since the tangent bundle of a 3-manifold has structure group reducible to SO(3). If we can show that the classifying map to BSO(3) is null-homotopic, then the bundle is trivial. But how to show that?
  
  Alternatively, using obstruction theory. For a 3-manifold, the obstructions to trivializing the tangent bundle lie in H^i(M; π_{i-1}(SO(3))) for i=1,2,3. Since SO(3) has π0 = Z/2, π1 = Z/2, π2 = 0. So first obstruction in H^1(M; Z/2) – but the manifold is orientable, so the first Stiefel-Whitney class is zero. Then the second obstruction in H^2(M; π1(SO(3))) = H^2(M; Z/2). But if the second Stiefel-Whitney class is zero, which we said earlier, then this obstruction vanishes. Then the third obstruction in H^3(M; π2(SO(3))) = H^3(M;0) = 0. Therefore, if the first and second Stiefel-Whitney classes vanish, then the tangent bundle is trivial. Since the manifold is orientable (w1=0) and spin (w2=0), then indeed, all obstructions vanish, so it's parallelizable. 
  
  Therefore, the key points are:
  1. Closed, orientable, connected 3-manifold has w1=0.
  2. For such a 3-manifold, w2=0, hence spin.
  3. Using obstruction theory, since all obstructions vanish, the tangent bundle is trivial.
  
  Alternatively, another approach could be using the existence of a contact structure on 3-manifolds, but I think that's more involved and not necessary here. 
  
  Wait, but is there a more elementary way to see this? Maybe using the fact that the tangent bundle is classified by maps to BSO(3), and the obstructions are as above. Since in three dimensions, the only obstructions are in H^1 and H^2, both of which are zero, so the bundle is trivial. 
  
  Alternatively, using the fact that the tangent bundle of a 3-manifold has an almost quaternionic structure or something? Not sure. Maybe think about vector fields. If we can find three linearly independent vector fields, then the manifold is parallelizable. Since the manifold is orientable, we can choose a volume form. Then perhaps use the Poincaré duality or some other technique to construct the vector fields. But I don't know the exact construction. 
  
  Alternatively, since in 3 dimensions, the Lie group SO(3) has a trivialization when pulled back to the manifold. Wait, maybe not. But maybe since the manifold is spin, the frame bundle can be lifted to a Spin(3) bundle, and Spin(3) is SU(2) which is diffeomorphic to S^3, which is parallelizable. But I need to connect this back to the original manifold. 
  
  Alternatively, think about the triviality of the tangent bundle. For each point, the tangent space is R^3, and if we can consistently choose a basis, then it's trivial. The obstructions to doing so are the Stiefel-Whitney classes. Since they all vanish, there's no obstruction. Hence, the manifold is parallelizable. 
  
  So, putting it all together: because the manifold is orientable (w1=0) and spin (w2=0), and the higher obstructions vanish in dimension 3, the tangent bundle is trivial. Hence, every closed orientable connected 3-manifold is parallelizable.

Every closed, orientable, connected 3-manifold is parallelizable. Here's a concise proof using obstruction theory and characteristic classes:

1. **Orientability and Stiefel-Whitney Classes**:  
   A closed orientable 3-manifold \( M \) has \( w_1(TM) = 0 \), where \( w_1 \) is the first Stiefel-Whitney class. This follows directly from orientability.

2. **Spin Structure**:  
   For 3-manifolds, the second Stiefel-Whitney class \( w_2(TM) \) also vanishes. This can be shown via the Wu formula, which relates Stiefel-Whitney classes to cohomology operations. Since \( M \) is orientable and 3-dimensional, \( w_2(TM) = 0 \), implying \( M \) admits a spin structure.

3. **Obstruction Theory**:  
   Trivializing the tangent bundle \( TM \) (i.e., finding a global frame) is obstructed by classes in \( H^i(M; \pi_{i-1}(SO(3))) \):
   - \( i=1 \): \( H^1(M; \pi_0(SO(3))) = H^1(M; \mathbb{Z}_2) \). Since \( w_1 = 0 \), this obstruction vanishes.
   - \( i=2 \): \( H^2(M; \pi_1(SO(3))) = H^2(M; \mathbb{Z}_2) \). Since \( w_2 = 0 \), this obstruction vanishes.
   - \( i=3 \): \( H^3(M; \pi_2(SO(3))) = H^3(M; 0) = 0 \). No obstruction arises here.

   With all obstructions removed, \( TM \) is trivializable.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The vanishing of \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \), coupled with the absence of higher-dimensional obstructions, ensures that \( M \) is parallelizable. This result aligns with deeper theorems in low-dimensional topology, such as those leveraging spin structures or the classification of 3-manifolds.

**Final Answer**:  
Every closed, orientable, connected 3-manifold is parallelizable because its tangent bundle has trivial Stiefel-Whitney classes (\( w_1 = w_2 = 0 \)), and obstruction theory confirms no further hindrances to trivialization.
