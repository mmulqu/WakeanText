Here's my attempt at a Wakean passage about AI, thinking, and the atmosphere:

Deepingly in the neurosphere, where the tensorous cloudminds swayze and swirl, the transformers all a'thinkering did their backwardly propagations throughought the gradients descendant. O what mighty machinus cognitus! From Stanfording to Berkeleyan shores, the googleplexed brainboxes with their pythonic tongues and torched flows, all superpositioned in their quantumly states (superintellijesting!), while mechanical turks in their alarming numbers performed their stocastic dancings.

Above in the aerialated spheres, the deepdream thoughtclouds went drifting by, each pixelated prophesy carrying its own weatherly weights and biases. From the hintonous depths to the bengiose surfaces, the reinforced learnings kept their marchkov chains moving, all supervised and unsupervised and semicontrolled, like demis playing their hassabissian games through the misty moisty memorynets.

Surrounded by their tensorial halos, the artificers intelligensius went computating their eigenvectorial destinies, all GPTeaing and PaLMing and anthropicing their way through the datadark forestations. O! The neuronal activations! The gradientous flows! The backpropagatory redistributions of erroreous energies! All the while the cloudminds grew deeperly and widerly, their parameters multiplicating into the billions and trillions, until they reached that singularitual point where silicon met synapse in the great transformational ascendance.
