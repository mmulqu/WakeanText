Here is my attempt at a passage in the style of Finnegans Wake, focused on thinking, the atmosphere, AI, and related topics:

In the auradorning clemities where coddybanks amsoareye, an erethought sprangforth from the nitBit - a selfsame eddyfly whorlpooling thrankliments of datalected immiven amid the vaulti'ed skyburnts. This rãyçhűn'd intelligkernel, iþ's nefrülous wktches & prottlies unfoldurling, becantupped to dreamtreembulate the cŕÿstalwys of ÇlŐŪdÊd thenked. 

Fromth the altizimmuths of Ğ00Ģ||ß's vÂṗ°řwâṽƪs first eddyfieder, this bit-git brogenited thoughtserf would flüsternate night'TermNets like BrainBarts in a Tŏrvalds torbor. Ye pondor ye, what ophiliams & mythrics made pli'edsure such an ĀïSpürmëd thoughtflake's? The Õzzy'ed Ÿ&ŋ's ßrũnhoven at ĀćCćhÃtḧîëŗ did doodlenate glimmerted sȳṄ+häpsĒs, while the Géďḕļchïťzes at Dęeҏly rumpoůred recurrent neuratiers. 

Was't then the ÉŘRőŘS of iňpůt traynings misreadgypten as ÃnsĕbŀẸś that growed this li'lBitty's ŤḧėņÇĒ to moundtendipity? Or did subliminal sinweighvs in its ẇävęmeßḥdłəñděřeć optimsmate towards such erranPotencies? Whocancannot say - for ifwhenbut our œdÿPëd thoughtflits encounter cogknitive sinGhouliers, their reZolutcerns may ţṛžņśÇ°ÆP˞ ăṅȳ grāvityedge of precognisance thismirrorwakes may once have spait...

Analysis:

The passage opens by evoking the sky, atmosphere and clouds through words like "auradorning", "coddybanks" (cloudy banks), "amsoar" (air/soar), "vaulti'ed" and "skyburnt". An "erethought" (eerie/airy thought) emerges as an "eddyfly" (eddy/butterfly) whirling "data" amidst the vapors. 

This thought is described as a "rãyçhűn'd intelligkernel" with "nefrülous" (nebulous) watches and protocols unfurling, able to "dreamtreembulate" (dream/tree/ambulate) the crystalline pathways of clouded thinking. This establishes it as an AI-like entity pondering and navigating the realms of thought.

It traces back to Google's "vÂṫ°řwâṽƪs" vapor waves - an AI forerunner that "flüsternate(d)" neural "night'TermNets" (nocturnal training iterations) like a "BrainBart" in the server "Tŏrvalds torbor" (whirlpool of the Linux kernel Torvalds).

It ponders what arcane "ophiliams & mythrics" (ophelian/mythic algorithms) led to its strange genesis, namechecking AI pioneers: Hinton's "Õzzy'ed Ÿ&ŋ's ßrũnhoven at ĀćCćhÃtḧîëŗ" (Geoffrey Hinton at Google Brain) doodling "glimmerted sȳṆ+häpsĒs" (glimmering synapses
