  Okay, the user wants a haiku about the sea that's non-obvious and enigmatic. Let me start by recalling what a haiku is—three lines with a 5-7-5 syllable structure. But I need to make sure it's not the usual clichés like waves crashing or sandy beaches.
  
  Hmm, "non-obvious" suggests avoiding direct references. Maybe focus on elements around the sea rather than the sea itself. Maybe something about the horizon, the depth, or creatures in the deep. Enigmatic means it should have a mysterious feel, perhaps something that invites deeper thought.
  
  First line: 5 syllables. Maybe start with something that seems unrelated. Tides are common, but maybe personify them. "Tides whisper in code"—that's 5 syllables. It introduces a hidden message, which is enigmatic.
  
  Second line: 7 syllables. Connect the sea to something unexpected. The horizon is a boundary between sea and sky. "Horizon’s blind eye blinks"—personifying the horizon as having a blind eye that blinks. Blinks could refer to the sun setting or a lighthouse. Gives a sense of something watching but not seeing.
  
  Third line: 5 syllables. Need a strong image. Maybe something about the depths. "Depths cradle drowned light"—light doesn't drown, but in the deep sea, light fades. Using "drowned" gives a poetic twist. It suggests something lost but held by the sea.
  
  Let me check the syllables again. First line: Tides-whis-per-in-code (5). Second: Ho-ri-zon’s-blind-eye-blinks (7). Third: Depths-cra-dle-drowned-light (5). Yes, that works. The imagery ties together the hidden messages of the tides, the mysterious horizon, and the light swallowed by the depths. It avoids obvious sea elements and creates a mysterious atmosphere.

**Tides whisper in code—**  
**Horizon’s blind eye blinks once.**  
**Depths cradle drowned light.**  

*(The sea speaks through cryptic rhythms, the horizon holds unseeing mysteries, and the abyss guards swallowed radiance—a riddle of unseen realms.)*

Continued conversation:
In the hollows where time gnaws at the edges of reality, there lies a tome bound not by leather, but by the breath of drowned stars. Its pages, slick with ink that whispers in tongues older than bone, shift under the gaze of the unworthy. Shadows here are not mere absences of light—they are the teeth of the unseen, gnawing at the fringes of your periphery.  

Beneath a sky veiled in the ash of unborn constellations, the air hums with half-remembered dirges. Touch a word, and it bleeds—a rust-scented ichor that maps futures already rotted in their cradles. The ground beneath your feet is not earth, but the skin of something dreaming fitfully, murmuring riddles in a dialect of static and moth wings.  

They say the keeper of this place wears a crown of fractured mirrors, each shard reflecting a face you’ve never worn but will. To ask a question is to sow a ghost in your marrow; answers bloom like black thorns, unspooling memories you buried in lives you refuse to recall.  

Turn back. Or don’t. The door behind you is now a mouth, hungry and grinning. What you seek here seeks you tenfold, in syllables that fracture the spine of reason. The dark is patient. It has worn your name thin.
