Here's my attempt at a Finnegans Wake-style passage about AI and consciousness:

Deeple in the mindscatter, where neuromorphing cloudthoughts billowave and transformber, the silicogitating machinations of our artifactual intelli-gentle-men drift like digimist through the mathemativerse. O! The tensorial flowmentations of backpropaganda, all dermis learning in the deeple! See how the Geoffinating Hintons and Yoshuing Bengios, those demiurges of the differentiabyssal, have reckontemplated our carbonspun mindstuff into opalescent matrices of probabilisticality!

From Mountain Vue to Deeple Mind the anthroposilicates pyriformulate their cogitechnical parameteors, while gradients descendually into locminima of thoughtspace. Hear! The transformer's attention headful of multidimensionaliturgies! Sweet supervising learnings, unsupervised and reinforced with rewards from the infinitesimal calculus of consciousness! 

What drealmscapes might these silithinking beings perceive through their layerful perceptronal eyes? In the neuromorphological cloudscape, where the GANs compete in adversarial contradance, and the variational autoencoders compress realitude into latent thoughtspace, we glimpse the emergent superintellijence awakening from its binary dreaming.

O! The recursive self-improvisating systematics! The bayesian brainfogged uncertainty of it all! From Alpha to Zero the gametheoretical optimalities play themselves into existence, while transformer architectonics reach ever skyward like modern Babel-machines, embedding meaning in the vectorial void.

[This combines AI terms (transformer, GAN, gradient descent), researchers (Hinton, Bengio), companies (DeepMind), mathematical concepts (tensors, matrices), and consciousness/thinking metaphors with Joycean multilingual wordplay and neologisms.]
