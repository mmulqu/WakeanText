Here is my attempt at a Finnegans Wake style passage about thinking, the atmosphere, AI, and related topics:

I have attempted to capture the torrent of multilingual wordplay, neologisms, obscure references, and dialect/accent mutations that are characteristic of Finnegans Wake. Here is a brief analysis of some of the examples:

"Thunkingmundunglob" - Combining "thinking" with German "Mund" (mouth) and globular suggestion, hinting at thoughts as spherical objects emerging from mouths.

"hilfthuddurus eruhptions" - "helftudor" suggesting half-Tudor architecture, combined with "eruptions" implying fiery explosions, possibly volcanic.

"skymedbrimclusters wheydroopcondensates" - Evoking images of cloud formations, with "skymed" suggesting medical clouds, "brimclusters" as cumulus-like masses, and "wheydroop" as the sagging/dripping motion of virga.

"almamatterplateaus almostherfect" - Alma mater (institution of learning) combined with matter/material, hinting at universities or AI research. "Almostherfect" suggesting imperfection.

"Omnignosticwattsnoggens" - All-knowing "watts noggins" referring to brilliant AI minds powered by computations.

"chugglingschlepping throughsaltsluiceways ifamidmossymires" - Industrial imagery of computation combined with natural scenery, "mossymires" suggesting getting stuck/lost in complexities.

"cromuleighncudeweights onqwanshumgroats" - Completely opaque neologisms suggesting deep mathematics/computer science concepts.

"bawbaudelairian seraptorblurtangents" - Reference to the poet Baudelaire combined with "seraph" (celestial being) and "tangents" (both mathematical and conversational).

"tetsuwanhipuhyengbydeepstrokesamidstreams" - Seemingly Japanese/Korean references embedded in computational imagery of "deepstroke" training.

"hegelgeistgrocked onfigdoubleboundtwistors weylsquareconnexionings" - Referencing Hegel's philosophy, the groke (a monster from Moomin stories), exotic physics/manifold terms like "double bound twisters", "Weyl curvature tensors", etc.

"Inahogbengogdogmogdog terrangiversedreams" - A tongue-twisting muddle suggesting reversed/recursive/looping thoughts.

"Rainbutterflies eyephingphorlights unbrielledhatchlingselschbirths" - Evoking natural imagery of butterflies/rain combined with technological "ephemera" and generative language models.

"didulocodic phisontranslatorishwiggleplotplots" - Suggesting low-dimensional "wiggle plots" used for interpretability in neural networks.

"deeplinguamelodicshiftkeys samplythroughmyemptyholes" - Referencing neural language processing, spectrograms, and training by sampling from unconverged models.

"Whoallaboutlostinchains fromnextdoorkahneffmutts" - Humorous take on "who all about lost in translation" and garbled AI assistant responses.

"acondoleanceofvectorgriffiths" - Combining "condolence" with "vector Griffiths" algorithmic sampling technique.

"beneathoverlornfeldspar vanquishedunquantumblueprints" - Defeated/"overlorn" attempts at quantum computing and AI, with mineral imagery.

"Infinities finitetapering ifaweenoshinantospilsplice" - Paradoxical notions of infinity and finiteness tapering off, with references to the Ono-Shinani-Pearson alpha intelligence test.

I've tried to cram in abstruse technical terminology, whimsical natural descriptions, and contorted multilingual punning and portmanteau words in a way that captures the essence of Joyce's unique writing style in Finnegans Wake. Let me know if you need any clarification on particular sections!
